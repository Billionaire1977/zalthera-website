# ZAL’THERA Governance Core

ZAL’THERA is a governance and audit architecture for AI and automation systems.

**Principle:** Policy → Identity → Safeguard → Audit → Execute  
**Constraint:** No autonomy. No hidden execution.

## What this repository represents
This repository contains the public baseline of the ZAL’THERA Governance Core:
- Governance model and architecture
- Audit & explainability structure
- Safeguard / timebox gating principles
- Example artifacts (policy samples, flow samples)

> ZAL’THERA does not build AI systems.  
> ZAL’THERA builds the control framework around them.

## Built for
- Industry / Mittelstand environments
- Automation teams
- Compliance-sensitive processes

## Core Guarantees
- **Controlled execution:** actions run only through explicit policy gates
- **Identity binding:** every action is attributable (issuer / scope / target)
- **Audit trail:** complete traceability (what / why / who / when)
- **Explainability:** clear reasons for allow/block decisions
- **Safeguards:** scoped overrides with timeboxing (no global override)

## Repository structure
- `docs/` – architecture, governance model, audit/explainability
